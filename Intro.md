#Intro

Neurona is an Arduino Library which allows boards to feed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures in order to perform tasks such as pattern recognition (classification), non-linear regression, function approximation and time-series prediction from the implemented architectures:

* Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) - [**training**](#training)
* Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ-1 - to be implemented)

Check also [MorettiCB][MorettiCBBlog]'s blog (or simply click a *training* link which follows an architecture) to choose a way to have a trained network, so the obtained collection of adjusted weights can be used with Neurona in operation mode.

This documentation encompasses the code reference and some examples, which can be easily accessed through the left menu.

## Download and Installation

If you want to install Neurona, you can either search for Neurona in Arduino's Library Manager or download by clicking the button below:

[Download Neurona >][NeuronaDownloadLink]

[Click here][ArduinoLibInstallHelp] if you need aditional help in the installation step.

##Compatibility

The following list enumerates the boards which Neurona have been tested.

* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Mega

If your board is not here, it simply means it was not tested yet. You can also test Neurona in your board and send us a feedback through an [issue](https://github.com/MorettiCB/Neurona/issues) :)
