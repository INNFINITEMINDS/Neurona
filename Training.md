#Training

## MLP

There are three ways to have an MLP trained and ready to use with Neurona:

* **MLP Topology Workbench** - a playground for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (quite useful):

* [**An implementation in C language**][CMLP]{:target="_blank"} of training (backpropagation with momentum term) and operation modes of an MLP

* A **third party software**, such as a [MATLAB Toolbox][MATLABNN]{:target="_blank"}, [Tensorflow Library][TFLibrary]{:target="_blank"}, and others.
